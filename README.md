- 👋 Hi, I’m @HKDngIT (Khiem)
- 👀 After years of theory in school, study and simple coding I want to finally put my know-how into use in the IT industry!
- ✨ I have basic knowledge in Java, C and C++...
- 😊 ... and in electrical science as well - I'm still a student at "Technische Hochschule Ulm"
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#
- 😄 Pronouns: He/ Him
- ⭐ Main goal is to grow my knowledge and add more and more projects to my repositories
- ⚡ Current and future project(s) for myself:
  - [ ] Rewrite most of my current source code of tasks from C++ to C#(if possible)
  - [ ] Analysis program for my aquarium water parameters (in C++ or Java I dont know yet)
  - [ ] Implement the same program into an android-application
